Ternary operators are also known as conditional expressions are operators that evaluate something based on a condition being true or false.
Syntax : 
[on_true] if [expression] else [on_false]
CODE:
a, b = 10, 20
mini = a if a < b else b
print(f"minimum value is {mini}")

OUTPUT:
minimum value is 10

a,b = 20,10
print(a,"is greater") if (a>b) else\
  print(b, "is greater")   
  
Above code will run FINE


a,b = 20,10
print(a,"is greater") if (a>b) else
  print(b, "is greater")
  
  
Above code will generate error :::  SyntaxError: invalid syntax
